# `ts-stash`

Unorganised location to formally put away unused common code (regardless of utility) clean of unused functions that could be re-used. Also used to store solutions to coding quizzes and a general playground to run and build TypeScript modules.

## Start

```sh
pnpm install

# To test each function
pnpm test

# Convert into JS
pnpm build


```
